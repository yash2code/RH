## Quick Start

### Install

In your OpenClaw chat, say:

> Install the RunningHub skill from https://github.com/HM-RunningHub/OpenClaw_RH_Skills

The assistant will clone the repo, copy files to the workspace, and guide you through API key setup.

### Update

When a new version is available, say in your OpenClaw chat:

> Update from https://github.com/HM-RunningHub/OpenClaw_RH_Skills and re-read @runninghub/SKILL.md

The assistant will pull the latest code and reload the skill config. No need to re-enter your API key.

### Prerequisites

- **API Key** — Get one from [RunningHub API Management](https://www.runninghub.cn/enterprise-api/sharedApi) (click "新建")
- **Wallet balance** — [Recharge here](https://www.runninghub.cn/vip-rights/4) — API calls require funds

## Usage

Once installed, just talk to your OpenClaw assistant in natural language:

- *"Generate a picture of a dog playing in the park"*
- *"Turn this photo into a video"*
- *"Create background music for my video"*
- *"Upscale this image to 4K"*
- *"Convert this image to a 3D model"*

The assistant automatically selects the best RunningHub endpoint based on your request.

### Video Model Selection

When generating video, the assistant presents 8 curated models to choose from:

> 1. 🚀 **Google Veo 3.1 Fast** — Fast with great quality, best value
> 2. 🔥 **Grok Video** — Grok-powered, incredible imagination
> 3. 🎯 **Kling v3.0 Pro** — Natural motion, best for people
> 4. 🎬 **Google Veo 3.1 Pro** — Cinematic quality
> 5. ✨ **Vidu Q3 Pro** — Unique stylized look
> 6. ⭐ **Sora** — Sora-class engine
> 7. 🌊 **MiniMax Hailuo** — Fast with fine details
> 8. 🌱 **Seedance v1.5 Pro** — Smooth motion, great for dance

Pick a number to start, or the default (Google Veo 3.1 Fast) is used automatically.
